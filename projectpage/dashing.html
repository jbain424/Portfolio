                <p class="info">
                    An app that brings together beauty & wellness professionals and services their clients in the
                    comfort of
                    their clients homes.

                    Dashing was built by a team of 5 in 6-weeks for our final Capstone project. Future iterations
                    included a mobile
                    responsive design which I created after Capstone. We also plan to create User Authentication for
                    providers and clients,
                    implement calendar functionality for booking and the ability to filter through provider
                    availability.

                    <p class="wireframe-info">The goal for this app was to create a sleek and unique UI to make the user
                        feel as if they're stepping into a high-end salon and also have the ability to choose from
                        top-class professionals that would provide great service. With that idea in mind, my focus was
                        to also create a seamless user flow and design that would compliment that high-end experience.

                <h3>Colors & Typography</h3>

                <p class="wireframe-info">In the beauty industry it is standard for providers to wear all black while at
                    work so we
                    wanted to keep that in mind and use black as the base color while designing this app. I decided that
                    a neutral pink tone would be great as a highlight since it represents skin and a pop of red to
                    represent a woman's favorite lipstick color. </p>

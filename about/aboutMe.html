        <div class="bio">
            <p>I’ve always been passionate about art, design and simply being creative. Art has always played a major role in my life, and as a child I was fortunate enough to have parents and teachers that fostered my talents.
                </br>
                </br>
                My interest in design grew even more once I went to college. At first, I studied commercial printing, packaging, and labeling but realized I loved visual design and changed my major to Graphic Design, which helped to develop my skills as a visual storyteller and creative thinker. After graduating from the CUNY Baccalaureate Program with an interdisciplinary degree in Graphic Design and Photography, I enjoyed the freedom of being a freelancer. My focus was on helping clients tell their stories visually about their brands with logos, business cards, promotional flyers,etc.
                </br> </br>

                A few years later, I applied and got accepted to Pursuit -- an intensive 10-month full-stack web development fellowship program -- where I gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React and NodeJS. During this time, I consistently demonstrated and improved my leadership and communication skills. While working on numerous individual and group projects I began to research UX/ UI design and felt like this field was more along the lines of what I wanted to do. My background as a graphic designer and photographer, with over 10 years of experience using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, has truly become the foundation on which I can finally merge my creative skills with my technical skills as a developer.
                </br> </br>
                Ultimately, my goal is to design products and experiences that are impactful and purposeful. I am excited to utilize new and cutting-edge technologies to improve people’s lives in innovative ways, all while contributing to the betterment of my community.

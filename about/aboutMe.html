        <div class="bio">
            <p>As a multi-disciplined artist by trade, I was fortunate to have my creative lens shaped by parents and
                mentors at an early age.  Those initial lessons were a huge influence in attaining my Graphic Design and
                Photography Degree from CUNY.</p>

            <p>I’ve spent a great deal of my post collegiate career as a niche freelancer, working exclusively with
                small businesses in helping to build their brand stories along with collateral  including logos, small
                websites, and business cards.</p>

            <p>Seeking a career shift and new challenge, I completed a full-stack web development fellowship program at Pursuit
                where I gained exposure to different coding languages through project based learning.  I also came to
                the realization that the UX / UI design space is where I wanted to spend time growing as an artist. </p>

            <p>Today, I design products and experiences that are impactful and purposeful.  I am lead by the idea of
                always contributing to the betterment of my community, using new and cutting-edge technologies to
                improve people’s lives.

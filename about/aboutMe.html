        <div class="bio">
            <p>I’ve always been passionate about art, design and simply being creative. Art has always played a major
                role in my life as a child and I was fortunate enough to have parents and teachers that fostered my
                talents.
                </br></br>
                My interest in design grew more once I went to college. At first,I majored in commercial printing,
                packaging, and labeling but realized I loved visual design and changed my major to Graphic Design which
                helped to develop my skills as a visual storyteller and creative thinker. After graduating from the CUNY
                Baccalaureate Program with an interdisciplinary degree in Graphic Design and Photography, I enjoyed the
                freedom of being a freelancer.
                My focus was on helping clients tell their stories visually about their
                brands with logos, business cards, promotional flyers, etc.
                </br></br>
                A few years later, I applied and got accepted to Pursuit -- an intensive 10-month full-stack web
                development program -- where I gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React and
                NodeJS. During this time, I consistently demonstrated and improved my leadership and communication
                skills. While working on numerous individual and group projects I began to research UX/ UI design and
                felt like this field was more along the lines of what I wanted to do. My background as a graphic
                designer and photographer, with over 10 years of experience using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and
                Lightroom, has
                truly become the foundation on which I can finally merge my creative skills with my new technical skills
                as a developer. I also believed having the experience as an engineer gives me more insight on how to
                design as a UX/UI designer since both teams work hand in hand when developing products for their
                clients.
                </br>
                </br>

                My goal is to design products and experiences that are impactful and purposeful. I am excited to utilize
                new and cutting edge technologies to improve people’s lives in innovative ways all while contributing to
                the betterment of my community.

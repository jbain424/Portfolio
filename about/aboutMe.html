            <p>My history with the arts began when I was very young. I grew up in a home where my parents encouraged
                myself and my younger brother to be free and to create. I was told that from a very young age I loved to
                draw… didn’t matter what medium, drawing always lit a spark in my young mind. During elementary school,
                I was encouraged most by my teachers and they let me hone in on my talents. When I was 9 my 4th grade
                teacher, Mrs. Mail taught us calligraphy. She was big on the arts. We created stories, bind our own
                books and did all of the illustration ourselves. One project that stood out the most to me was titled,
                “What do I want to be in the year 2000?” And my answer was simply “A Card Maker.” That’s when it all
                began…

                My interest in design grew more once I went to college. I started off majoring in commercial printing,
                packaging and labeling but realized I loved the visual design and switched my major to graphic arts..
                After graduating college with an interdisciplinary degree in Graphic Design and Photography, I enjoyed
                the freedom of being a freelancer. My focus was helping clients build their brands with logos, business
                cards, promotional flyers.
